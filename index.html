        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Semantic elements are the directions in html that explain to both the developer and the browser what is supposed to happen. They are the pieces that build the structure of what will be seen and how it will be shown. It affects the big picture format of the web page being built including elements such as header and footers, articles, asides, and navigation. But it also affects how text is shown and emphasized.</p>
